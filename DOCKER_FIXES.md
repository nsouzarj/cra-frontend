# Docker Configuration Fixes

## Problem
The Nginx frontend container was failing to start with the error:
```
host not found in upstream "backend" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:23
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by Nginx trying to resolve the "backend" hostname before the backend service was fully started and available in the Docker network.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated Nginx Configuration
Modified [nginx.conf](file:///d:/Projetos/craweb/cra-frontend/nginx.conf) to:
- Use Docker's internal DNS resolver for dynamic service discovery
- Add proper timeout configurations for backend connections
- Implement error handling with custom error pages when the backend is unavailable
- Configure reverse proxy to properly forward API requests to the backend service

### 2. Enhanced Dockerfile
Updated [Dockerfile](file:///d:/Projetos/craweb/cra-frontend/Dockerfile) to:
- Copy the backend error page to the Nginx HTML directory
- Ensure proper startup sequence with multi-stage build process

### 3. Added Health Checks
Created [docker-compose.override.yml](file:///d:/Projetos/cra-frontend/docker-compose.override.yml) with:
- Health checks for both frontend and backend services using wget to test connectivity
- Proper startup dependencies and timing with start_period to allow services to initialize
- Health check intervals and retry configurations for better reliability

### 4. Error Handling
Added a custom error page [backend-error.html](file:///d:/Projetos/craweb/cra-frontend/src/backend-error.html) that will be displayed when the backend service is unavailable.

## How to Test the Fix
1. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The frontend should now start successfully and proxy API requests to the backend service.

3. If the backend is unavailable, users will see a friendly error message instead of a Nginx error.

## Additional Notes
- The backend service automatically adds the '/api' prefix to all routes, so frontend calls should use paths like `/cra-api/auth` which will be proxied to `/api/auth` on the backend
- The frontend and backend services are on the same Docker network and can communicate using service names
- The health checks ensure proper startup order and service availability
- For development access from other devices on the same network, use your machine's IP address with the appropriate port mapping

## Recent Enhancements
1. Added restart policies to all services to handle temporary failures
2. Improved Nginx configuration with better caching for static assets
3. Enhanced error handling with more informative error pages
4. Added proper MIME type configuration for better asset serving
5. Implemented gzip compression for improved performance
