Favicon Setup Instructions for CRA Frontend Project
==================================================

1. Location for favicon.ico:
   Place your favicon.ico file in the src/ directory (not in assets)

2. Current configuration:
   The angular.json file is already configured to look for favicon.ico in src/

3. HTML reference:
   The src/index.html file already includes the favicon reference:
   <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">

4. To add your favicon:
   - Delete this instructions file
   - Place your actual favicon.ico file in the src/ directory
   - The favicon should be a valid .ico file (not .png or .jpg renamed)

5. Recommended favicon sizes:
   - 16x16 pixels
   - 32x32 pixels
   - 48x48 pixels
   You can create a multi-resolution favicon that includes all these sizes.
